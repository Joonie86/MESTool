Crafted by the famed demon-smith
Rodin, these four guns have been
crowned with the names Parsley, 
Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme.
Pushing Bayonetta's magic to its
limits, these guns' rate of fire and[next]stopping power are incredible.[next]

Shotguns containing the souls of 
fairies known to collect the Onyx
Roses that bloom only in Inferno.
Each shell fired from the guns
contains the curse of the 
fairies' trapped souls.[next]

A living katana, pulsing with the
heart of Asura, the demon god of
war. Always seeking blood, the
blade will even suck the very souls
out of its victims. [next]

A possessed whip, sealing away
the soul of the ancient serpentine
demon Kulshedra. Summoning the
power of the demon from a portal
on the weapon's hilt, it can be used
in the same manner as a normal
whip.[next]

These skates hold the soul of the
demon witch Odette, who traded
her soul for eternal youth,
transforming into a swan.
Residing in the frozen hell of
Cocytus, legend has it that Odette[next]made a pact with the stubborn
demon queen Odile, allowing her to
fall to her prefered circle of hell.
Odette, said to have prided herself
on her ice magic abilities, lends the
blades of these skates the terrifying[next]ability to summon up the cold.[next]

His campaign of slaughter on the
battlefield leading to his swift
consignment to hell, the soul of the
Vietnam War madman Lt. Col.
Kilgore now resides in these
grenade launchers, which [next]fire explosive shells with
incredible magic power.[next]

Possessed by the soul of the fastest
bird demon in all of Inferno, Sai
Fung, these nunchaku spin at
blazing speed, unleashing attacks
so fast that even a god would be
unable to catch a glimpse.[next]

The soul of Durga, said to be a
demon with a thousand arms, is
imprisoned within these razor
sharp claws. From the portal at its
hilt, the weapon can summon two
types of arms, fire and lightning, to[next]bear against enemies. [next]

Four guns created by an unknown
super-civilization. Powered by an
energy source known as
Bazillionium, the deep crimson
flash from the guns instantly break
down the molecular bonds within[next]its target. Able to discern the intent
of its user, it is said that these
strange, miraculous guns have the
power to open a portal to another
dimension. Thanks to Rodin, the
guns also have gained demonic[next]powers, making them an incredible
threat to the denizens of Paradiso.[next]

A vessel for the demonic being 
Mahavairocana, said to have
seduced women by whispering
sweet nothings during their
dreams, Pillow Talk has incredible
angel killing power thanks to[next]Rodin's conjuring abilities. The
demonic power summoned from
the portal at the weapon's hilt takes
the form of a strangely glowing
green blade of light capable of
slicing foes cleanly in half.[next]

Handguns[next]

Umbran Sisters[next]

Four powerful handguns, crafted
by the famed demon-smith, Rodin,
and crowned with the names
Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and
D'Artagnan. Pushing one's magical
powers to their limits, these guns'[next]rate of fire and stopping power are
incredible.[next]

Shotguns containing the souls 
of fairies known to collect the
Garnet Roses that bloom only in
Inferno. Each shell fired from
the guns contains the curse of
the fairies' trapped souls.[next]

A katana born in the unknown
depths of Inferno, brimming with
mystery. One legend states that it
is the twin sword to Shuraba. It is
also said the sword's name comes
from the story of a witch who loved[next]the sword, and was
excommunicated for carrying out a
futile war against the angels. While
the sword did not contain the soul
of a demon, the Angel Slayer
displayed incredible power;[next]however, the sword, and the witch
in whose hand it was held, both
found themselves in Inferno.
Eventually, the blade passed 
into the hands of Rodin who 
was able to make up for its[next]previous deficiency; however, it
remains unknown what sort of
demon the smith was able to seal
away in the historic blade.[next]

A possessed whip, sealing away
the soul of the ancient serpentine
demon Vritra. Summoning the
power of the demon from a portal
on the weapon's hilt, it can be used
in the same manner as a normal[next]whip.[next]

Cursed to dance endlessly, Karen,
banished to the icy hell of Cocytus,
now finds her soul sealed within
Rodin's handiwork. The blades of
these skates are able to release
incredible cold, giving those skilled[next]in leg techniques frightening power;
however, those without the power
to fight the curse will find
themselves losing control of the
skates and dancing endlessly until
their death.[next]

A grenade launcher containing the
soul of Col. Slade, a man who
traded his eyesight to a demon to
save his troops, only to be deceived
by the hellish denizen and find
himself consigned to Inferno. Each[next]shot fired from the launcher's tube
is filled with Col. Slade's endless
malice.[next]

Possessed by the soul of the fastest
bird demon in all of Inferno, Tang
Lung, these nunchaku spin at
blazing speed, unleashing attacks
so fast that there is not a god or
demon in existence able to see[next]them coming.[next]

The soul of Kali, said to be a
demon with a thousand arms, is
imprisoned within these razor
sharp claws. From the portal at its
hilt, the weapon can summon two
types of arms, fire and lightning, to[next]bear against enemies. [next]

Four guns created by an unknown

A enigmatic weapon crafted by
the Umbra Witches, this weapon
is the pinnacle of their
moon-driven technology, and can
emit various colored blades
depending on the demon held[next]within... 
"Incognito as a mild-mannered
high school teacher, Jeanne
defends her innocent students at
all costs, transforming into the
super heroine, Cutie J! Her[next]blood red blade will cut the
ribbon and start class on the
finer points of justice! 
Bring evil to justice, Cutie J!
End their reign with your 
deadly Dynamic J!"[next]

Automatic handguns produced by
Rodin. Unable to withstand the
intensity of magic-imbued bullets
or melee attacks, those capable of
such feats must be careful in
holding back their full power.[next]

Magical weapons used in the
Umbran martial techniques
collectively known as the Bullet
Arts. While resembling a flintlock
pistol, the Umbran Sisters have
been in use long before the 15th[next]century appearance of the human-
crafted flintlocks. Whether it be
magical melee attacks, or rapid fire
via magically apportioned bullets,
the Umbra Sisters are capable of
fully exploiting their user's magical[next]abilities.[next]

Climax Brace[next]

Made by Matryona, a witch from
the principality of Moscow, this
brace allows the user to call upon
the strength of the demon to which
they are contracted, and [red]divide
themselves into multiple beings[white].[next]By using this treasured item,
Matryona was able to face several
foes at once during battle. Her
exploits have recently come back
into vogue, leading her to become
the model for the Russian[next]Matryoshka folk dolls. 
(Hold [Y] [0x1002] [B] to activate the

Used to summon the infamous
band of demon youth known as

It is said that long ago, the witch
Turandot crafted this treasure
while in the service of the Queen of
Lhasa, hoping that the butterfly
would give users divine protection.
Butterflies of Protection flutter[next]around the bracelet's user,
[red]absorbing attacks on their behalf[white]
before breaking up. [next](Hold [Y] [0x1002] [B] to activate the
effect. Depletes Magic Gauge.)[next]

An ancient brace crafted by the
Egyptian witch Cleopatra. When its
wearer is attacked, [red]Witch Time will

Egyptian practitioners of magic,[next]Cleopatra developed this guard to
assist those who had trouble
grasping the finer points of Witch
Time.[next]

Magical beads crafted by the witch
Akko while in the service of the
ancient Japanese queen Himiko.
When its user [red]dodges incoming
danger, the beads will launch a
magical counter-strike against the[white][next][red]attacker[white]. While the attack is
incredibly powerful, it sucks the
emotional strength from its user,
stripping them of the ability to
activate Witch Time.[next]

Cursed braces containing the soul
of Musso Koroni, an ancient
African goddess said to be the
goddess of discord. Placing these
braces upon one's arms is said to
be an affront to Paradiso,[next][red]summoning upon its wearer the
wrath of the heavens[white]. During the
witch hunts, the Malinese witch
Karaba, was forced into these
gauntlets, in which she was
brutally murdered by angels.[next]

Braces blessed by Shiva, the
Indian goddess of destruction.
Said to have been crafted by the
witch Yaksi while serving the
Vijayanagara Empire, legend
states the braces have the power to[next]repel an enemy's attack. Yaksi was
purported to have been invincible,
as her mastery of this techinque
allowed her to nullify any attack, no
matter what the strength. [next](Push [LS] in the direction
of the enemy the instant you are
attacked.)[next]

American Navajo legends states
that these braces were crafted by
the witch known as Yenaldooshi.
They allow their user to [red]replenish
their vitality[white] by [red]taunting an enemy[white].
Turquoise, shunned as a source of[next]magical power, is still in use today
in Navajo talismans.[next]

A treasured article worn only by the
elders of the Umbra Witches, these
bracelets are both incredibly
powerful and symbols of status.
Said to have been crafted by the
ancient and universally feared[next]witch queen Aizen, slipping this
onto one's arms would allow one
to [red]regenerate their magical powers[white].
Legend states that the strange
crow's head on the braces is
actually Aizen transformed, and[next]she will severely punish anyone
who attempts to use the braces
that she deems unworthy.
(Magic will be automatically
replenished up to two gauge
segments.)[next]

Eva, a truly extraordinary
witch, entered into contract with a

control Witch Time at their very
will.

Nicknamed Bloody for her ruthless
tactics in battle, these decorative
braces were crafted by the feared
witch, Mary. Especially proficient at

masterful fighters, as if they were
marionettes being controlled by
Mary herself.

another accessory. Using this 
accessory on any difficulty setting

A mysterious treasure that pushes
all who use it to a climax in power.
Where, when, and how it was
made all remain a mystery;
however, it is said to have come
from a different dimension. Its[next]incredible power is feared both by
angels and demons, who have
reached a mutual understanding
that its power is not to be
unleashed on the battlefield, no
matter what conflict arises.[next][red]Note: Equipping this item prevents
any records set during its use from
being officially recorded.[white][next]
